# ⏳ Chrome Extension for Time Management

**User-tracking** is a Chrome extension built to help you **take meaningful breaks**, manage your screen time, and stay aware of how much time you're spending online.  
It was mainly built because I realized I spend too much time on my PC — this tool reminds me to take breaks and helps me manage my time better.

Built using:
- ⚛️ **JavaScript** for the frontend
- 🌱 **Spring Boot** for backend integration
- 📈 **Chart.js** for rich data visualizations
