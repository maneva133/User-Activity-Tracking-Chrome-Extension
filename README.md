   ```

### 2. Restart Backend Server

1. Stop your backend server (Ctrl+C)
2. Rebuild and restart:
   ```bash
   cd user-tracking-extension-backend
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

### 3. Reload Chrome Extension

2. Click the reload button on your extension
3. Or remove and re-add the extension

## How to Use

## Troubleshooting

### "Error analyzing usage" message
- Check if your Gemini API key is correct
- Ensure you have sufficient Gemini API quota
- Verify your backend server is running
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

### "Server not running" message
- Make sure your backend server is started
- Check if it's running on port 8080
- Verify database connection

### API Key Issues
- Ensure your Gemini API key is valid and has quota
- Check if the key has the necessary permissions
- Verify the key is properly set in application.properties

## Cost Considerations

- Each analysis request uses Gemini API tokens
- Gemini Pro is currently free for most usage (with quotas)
- Monitor your Gemini usage at https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

## Security Notes

- Never commit your API key to version control
- Consider using environment variables for production
- The API key is only used server-side and not exposed to the frontend
